# Retail Sales and Price Forecasting

## Introduction

This project focuses on forecasting sales and prices for a retail company that operates both physical and online stores. Using a synthetic dataset that mimics real-world retail data, we analyze sales trends and predict future prices using linear regression.

## Objectives

1. **Analyze Sales Trends**: Understand sales patterns over time and across different channels (online and physical stores).
2. **Forecast Prices**: Predict future prices to help with pricing strategies and inventory management.
3. **Visualize Data**: Create visualizations to make the analysis and predictions easy to understand.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Date**: The date of the sales transaction.
- **Region**: The geographical region of the sale.
- **Channel**: Whether the sale was online or in a physical store.
- **Product**: The product sold.
- **Units_Sold**: Number of units sold.
- **Revenue**: Total revenue generated from the sale.

## Methodology

### Data Preparation

- **Clean the Data**: Handle missing values and ensure all columns are in the correct format.
- **Create Features**: Add new columns like 'Price' (Revenue per Unit Sold), 'DayOfWeek', 'Month', and 'DayOfYear'.

### Trend Analysis

- **Daily and Monthly Trends**: Plot daily and monthly revenue to identify patterns.
- **Channel and Regional Trends**: Compare sales trends between online and physical stores, and across different regions.

### Price Forecasting

- **Feature Extraction**: Use 'DayOfWeek', 'Month', and 'DayOfYear' as features.
- **Linear Regression**: Fit a linear regression model to predict prices.
- **Forecast**: Predict prices for the next 30 days and visualize the results.

## Results

The project demonstrates how to analyze sales trends and forecast prices using linear regression. The model provides reasonable price predictions, which can be useful for making pricing and inventory decisions.

## Conclusion

This project provides a basic approach to sales and price forecasting in the retail industry. Future improvements could include using more advanced forecasting models to increase prediction accuracy.
